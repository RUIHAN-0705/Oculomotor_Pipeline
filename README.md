# Oculomotor_Pipelines
 Contains the matlab code used to process behavior and neural data from Primate experiment with read & write probe
 behavior pipeline can be used to process behavior data, specifically eye position data 
 Neural pipeline can be used to process neural data recoded by NP10 read&write probe 
 Neural Data Analysis is the code used to analyze the neural data after spike sorting together with the previous behavior data
